## Sign up to Crypto Exchanges now
Most exchanges are getting full and [Bitfenix](https://www.bitfinex.com) halted signups in December 2017. I suggest that you get accounts setup as soon as possible and get yourself verified.

Ensure that you sign up with [Binance Exchange](https://www.binance.com/?ref=13896895) for #altcointrading and get your trading account going. 

## Get a Ledger Nano S
Read my [review of the Ledger Nano S](https://www.naschenweng.info/2017/12/07/ledger-s-crypto-currency-hardware-wallet/) on my blog. It is worthwhile to have a hardware wallet.


## Get started
TBC - tested code will release by 31st January. For the last 2 weeks I have been trading on [Bitfenix](https://www.bitfinex.com) with Ripple, IOTA, DATA. I moved $300 in IOTA trades to $600. Ripple moved from $300 to $1000.

In the image below you can see a "long" executing on a USD/DATA trade:

Since I am happy with how Bitfenix trading works, I have now moved to [Binance Exchange](https://www.binance.com/?ref=13896895) to test XVG (Verge) and TRX (Tron).
